# Why another keyboard layout?
Computer keyboards are not designed with human hand in mind:
* pinkies are used for heavy work e.g. holding down keys and extending to the sides
* thumbs are the strongest finger, yet underutilised
* keys are not positioned according to natural finger movement
* overflow of keys makes touch typing awkward
Combine that with standard QWERTY and you get contortionist's heaven.
# What does this layout rectify?
Some of the issues can not be fixed due to physical design and thus this layout is `poor man's ergo`.

Yet ...
## Move righ hand closer to Enter/Return
In doing so right thumb has convenient access to right modifier keys and this opens an universe of its own. Right pinky is restricted as to how many keys it presses as well.
Bonus: Widenind the hand position opens up your chest and shoulder area. 
## AltGr Universe
Holding AltGr presents sub-layout with:
### Better than vi navigation
* OEAI cluster becomes arrows for navigation
* U - PgUp
* Y - PgDown
* R - Home
* H - End

Did I mention that Space is Tab here? Can you feel the comfort of tapping happily with those thumbs to get your autocompletion going?
### Deleting left and right
* D - Del
* Z - Backspace
### Symbols
Some of which are mnemonic:
* P - parentheses
* L - less than
* G - greater than
* Q - Esc
* C - Colon
## Move modifier keys
So that some are thumb pressable. CapsLock being useless for decades decided to be responsible for changing layouts.
## QWERTY no more
Assigning letters to fingers is debatable, because it depends on vocabulary, but separating consonants and vowels combined with placing frequent characters on more dominant fingers and/or around home row ... well that is recepie for comfortable typing.
